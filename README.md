## scicm: Science Colour Maps

**scicm** is a small package containing several colour maps created using viscm.

The package is available for installation using `>pip install scicm`, though you may get directly from GitHub using `>pip install git+https://github.com/MBravoS/splotch.git@master`. On import the colour maps are registered with matplotlib, so they can be used
by passing `cmap='scicm.colour_map_name'` to any plotting function that has `cmap` as one of its keywords.

Available colour maps:
